How to make this program work:
The SQLite JDBC v 3.8.7.jar needs to be added to the CLASSPATH in order for the SQLite Database class to work. It essentially works as per the specification. The database CANNOT exist when the program is run. The next programer will need to deal with the majority of the Exceptions (since any URLs that do not get saved will mess up the programmers search() function if the program runs without error).
